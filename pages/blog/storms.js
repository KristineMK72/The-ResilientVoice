          Through the Storms: How God’s Grace Shaped My Mission
        </h1>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Life has a way of testing our strength, humbling our pride, and
          breaking us open just enough for light to shine through. Every storm
          I’ve walked through—heartbreak, loss, uncertainty, and the silent
          battles no one sees—has shaped me. Through it all, God’s grace has
          been the anchor holding me steady.

          <strong>The Resilient Voice</strong> was born from that place of
          redemption. It’s more than an apparel line; it’s a mission. Every
          design carries a message of faith, healing, and resilience—a reminder
          that even in your darkest valleys, grace is still chasing you.

          I created this brand for anyone who has ever felt unseen, unheard,
          or overwhelmed. I wanted each piece to whisper a simple truth:

        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-800">
          You are not alone.  
          You have strength.  
          You are seen.

          Part of walking in purpose means giving back, which is why{" "}
          <strong>10% of all proceeds</strong> support nonprofits doing
          meaningful, life-impacting work:

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-1">
          <li>🕊️ Suicide prevention & awareness programs</li>
          <li>💬 Anti-bullying initiatives</li>
          <li>💚 Mental health support networks</li>
          <li>🏠 Homelessness relief organizations</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          These causes matter deeply to me because I’ve lived in the spaces where
          hope feels far away. I know what it means to need just one voice, one
          message, one act of compassion to keep going.

          As this mission continues to grow, my prayer is that it becomes a
          community of people who lift each other up, speak life, and carry God’s
          grace into the world.
